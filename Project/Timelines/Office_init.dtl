Well, better get to it then.
You make your way to the Relations Department, and push open the door. Being one of the smaller departments of the company, your office wasn’t much bigger than the average meeting room. Walking in, you’re greeted by the familiar scene of desks, chairs, and filing cabinets. There were only two other people with you in this department\: your friend Jordan, a greyhound who always wore an inquisitive look, and your supervisor Molly, a black bat whose big eyes commonly had a tired look to them. Being that there were so few of you, the three of you decided to just push your desks together in the middle, and save as much space as possible for other things, like the set of couches and chairs you were able to fit in along the walls, making the place feel a bit more comfortable.
You met Jordan when you initially got hired, as she was also placed in the same department you were, leading to the two of you becoming good friends. Molly was your supervisor, but acted much more like a friend. You were very appreciative to them some days more than others, as working at this company could be really dry sometimes.
You’re all alone in the room. You shut the door behind you, and walk over to your desk, sinking down into your squeaky chair and leaning back.
Jesse: Sigh…wonder where Jordan is. Did she go to Molly’s meeting too?
Being Monday, today was the day when all the department heads met together for a short meeting. Typically this was the time where you and Jordan would have a few moments together before Molly came into the office. Lately the two of you have taken to trying to scare her when she would walk into the office, and as such, have used this time to plan out your next attack. Jordan not being here was a bit of a surprise though. Molly would usually bring one of you with her in case she needed help bringing files back down, but she had said that this week was just a check in, and no planning was going on.
Jesse: Guess I’ll just get started.
