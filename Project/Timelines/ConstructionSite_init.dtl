Turning a corner, you see what appears to be a construction area.
There are warning signs, various tools, carts of building supplies, and caution tape scattered all over the place.
In front of you, a set of blue doors look to be the entrance into the construction inside.
Jesse (Fox): Must be renovations, I remember hearing about that. Lot of people weren’t too happy they had to walk an extra minute to their office. Well, gotta get your steps in somehow…

As you look around, you notice a lion, turning the corner at the other end of the hallway, wearing a black suit and sunglasses with dark lenses. They’re pushing a cart while slightly hunched over, with a few stacked crates on it with one hand, wheels squeaking as it moves along, and reading something on a clipboard with the other. They do not notice you until they get a little closer, and quickly tuck the clipboard under their arm, nodding to you as they turn and wheel into the construction site.
You snort to yourself.
Jesse: Would I get a promotion if I reported an OSHA violation? More likely to get fired, I bet. What are they even doing there? This stuff looks like it’s been here forever.
