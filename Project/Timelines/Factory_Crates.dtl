You see some crates stacked in a corner that look very similar to the ones you saw those crocodiles pushing two days ago.
You walk over to them, and see that the top of one of the crates has been removed. Looking inside, you see a number of large metal cylinders.
Reading some of these labels, you see words like “testosterone”, “estrogen”, and “progesterone”.
Jesse: So that order form was about this stuff! Looks like all these crates are full of it…what are they planning to use it for?
do Game.set_POI_visible("FactoryLevel", "CratesPOI", false)
jump Factory_Remote/increment
