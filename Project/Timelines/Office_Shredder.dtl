You notice the paper shredder, packed to the brim and overflowing.
Jesse: Ugh, I just emptied this last week…who was in here just pouring paper into this thing?! There’s no way we did all this in a few days.
Upon further inspection, you see that the paper in the shredder appears to be in tiny, misshapen, uneven pieces. There isn’t anything legible that you can see.
Jesse: It’s like someone put these through a bunch of times…were they that sensitive?
Jesse: What’s this?
You see a piece of ripped paper poking out of the shredder. It appears that once this paper got stuck, instead of fixing it, the paper was ripped out of the shredder, leaving the jammed portion inside.
Jesse: Wonder who’ll have to sort this out…did they seriously run off?!
You roll your eyes. You do wonder what could’ve been on those papers though: it looks like someone really didn’t want someone else seeing them.
