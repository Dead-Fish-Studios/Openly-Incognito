Seeing something on Jesse’s, you move over to look at what appears to be a disassembled walkie-talkie. There’s a bunch of small screwdrivers and mechanical components scattered around the desk.
Jesse: What is this? Did Jordan bring this in? This type of thing would be right up her alley…but I thought we stopped using these.
You heard that Blurr Sector used to use walkie-talkies for inter-department communication, but quickly stopped due to a wave of complaints\: the constant beeping and loud static sound was really distracting.\
Looking at it, it appears that someone was working on the inside of this walkie-talkie but stopped right before they put the covering panel on. The antenna has also been removed and replaced with an odd looking metal piece, much shorter and bent in multiple places.
Taking a look around, a grin forms on your face before replacing the cover and picking it up.
Jesse: Sure she won’t mind if I give it a spin, right?
You turn the walkie-talkie on and jump as it starts emitting a very loud, high-pitched screeching sound.
Jesse: Ahhh, shit!
You almost drop the walkie-talkie as you fumble with, trying to turn down the volume. You turn it down and let out an exhale, the screeching now an audible static sound.
Jesse: Of course it was on full blast.
Looking at the screen, it’s clear that someone was tinkering with the walkie-talkie as instead of a frequency number, you see the text\: “ERROR”.
Jesse: Must be busted… still though, kinda cool looking. Maybe I’ll hang onto it for a while. It’s probably Jordan’s, I’ll just give it back to her when she asks.
You pocket the walkie-talkie.
