You see a set of two swinging doors with PPE signs on them, closed, presumably leading into the construction site. 
The doors have a little window at eye level on each of them.
Peering into the windows, you notice that theyâ€™re very dirty, making it hard to see through them clearly. 
It appears the room inside is darker as well, adding to the strain you put on your eyes to see through the small plastic window. 
You can make out a figure, but only by silhouette. They seem to just be standing there, a few meters from the door. 
After some time, they continue moving again, suddenly going out of view.
do Game.set_POI_label("ConstructionSiteLevel", "CSiteDoorPOI", "inspect")
label inspect
- try to look inside again
	You keep trying to look for any sign of movement through the window, but see nothing.
	Jesse: Huh.
	jump inspect
- enter
	Quickly making sure that no one was coming, you slip in the doors and quietly close them behind you before turning around.
	do Game.switch_level("ConstructionSiteRoomLevel")
- (move on)
