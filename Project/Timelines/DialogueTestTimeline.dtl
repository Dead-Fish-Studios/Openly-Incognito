Deciding to take a look around, you walk down the left hallway. You usually don’t ever have to come to this side of the building as this was for different departments from your own. You see many different people you normally don’t, but sometimes spot the off familiar person, quickly walking by, lost in thought. Deciding to take a look around, you walk down the left hallway.

It was odd, leisurely walking through a crowd of people so absorbed in their work. It made you feel a little out of place, but also gave you a heightened sense of perception\: you felt like you were the only one truly aware of your surroundings.
Picking a direction, you continue to walk and notice that the crowd of people starts to thin out a bit. You must be nearing the side of the building, away from the constant traffic of the most inner sections. Turning a corner, you see what appears to be a construction area. There are warning signs, various tools, carts of building supplies, and caution tape scattered all over the place. A sign in the middle of the walkway states\: “Area under construction, do not enter”. You see a set of two swinging doors with PPE signs on them, closed, presumably leading into the construction site. The doors have a little window at eye level on each of them.
Jesse (Placeholder/Placeholder Fox): Must be renovations, I remember hearing about that. Lot of people weren’t too happy they had to walk an extra minute to their office. Well, gotta get your steps in somehow…
- 1) Examine the tools lying around. (Go to A)
- 2) Look through the windows on the doors. (Go to B)
Jesse: I know construction takes some time, but come on, this is ridiculous. I just saw someone go in! Are they focusing on a different area? Still, this is like months of dust, at least, I can write my name in it. Why wouldn’t they be using this stuff?
